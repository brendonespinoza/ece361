# ECE 361 Fall 2026 project 26: Cleanroom pressure monitor

**Project 26. Device type D:** monitor and logger. **Key** K1, **second structure** S4, **report** Q2.

This sheet is your specification for the whole term. The project assignment holds the rules that apply to everyone (individual work, AI use, the final exam). This sheet says what you build, what you hand in, and how you show that it works.

## 1. Your device

You build an embedded system, a.k.a. a device: a small computer inside a machine that reads sensors, makes decisions, and drives the hardware. This sheet calls it your device. Yours is a monitor for a semiconductor cleanroom. iom361 has no pressure sensor, so this monitor watches the other two things a cleanroom must hold tightly: temperature and humidity. It controls nothing and logs everything.

**Device type D, monitor and logger:** You control nothing. You detect conditions outside a safe range, raise an alarm on the LEDs, and hold it until a switch acknowledges it. The record is the product, so your store and your report carry more of the weight than your state machine.

## 2. Your hardware: iom361

Every project in this course runs on the same hardware, and that hardware is a model. **iom361** is a small C library that imitates an I/O board attached to a microcontroller: switches, LEDs, an RGB LED, and an AHT20 temperature and humidity sensor.

On a real microcontroller, a program talks to hardware through **memory-mapped registers**: fixed memory addresses where each bit means something. Write a 1 to a bit of the LED register and an LED lights up; read the temperature register and you get the sensor's latest measurement. iom361 gives you exactly that, as a block of eight 32-bit registers in your computer's memory. Your code reads and writes registers the way it would on a board, but it runs on your laptop, and your tests can control what the "hardware" sees. Roy Kravitz wrote iom361 for ECE 361; this term we use version 4.0 (r4), which fixes several problems of the earlier version and adds two functions. We cover memory-mapped I/O in week 6. Until then, use iom361 as a black box through the functions below.

### The files

Download the iom361 folder from Canvas. It holds:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `iom361_r4.h` | the interface: the register map, the return codes, and every function, with comments |
| `iom361_r4.c` | the library itself |
| `README.md` | what iom361 models, how to use it, and what changed from earlier versions |
| `demo_iom361_r4.c` | a short program that exercises every register; `make` builds it |
| `test_iom361_r4.c` | the library's own tests; `make test` runs them |

Run `make` and `make test` in that folder once, before you write any code. If both work, your compiler and iom361 work together.

Then copy `iom361_r4.h` and `iom361_r4.c` into `project/`, write `#include "iom361_r4.h"` in the files that use it, and add `iom361_r4.c` to the source files in your `Makefile`. Do not change either file. If you think iom361 has a bug, ask on Agora.

### The registers

| Offset | Register | Direction | What it holds |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x00` | `SWITCHES_REG` | read | one bit per switch, bit 0 first; 1 means on |
| `0x04` | `LEDS_REG` | read, write | one bit per LED, bit 0 first; 1 means lit |
| `0x08` | `RGB_LED_REG` | read, write | bit 31 enable; bits 23 to 16 red, 15 to 8 green, 7 to 0 blue duty cycle |
| `0x0C` | `TEMP_REG` | read | a 20-bit raw value ST; temperature in °C = ST / 2^20 × 200 − 50 |
| `0x10` | `HUMID_REG` | read | a 20-bit raw value SRH; humidity in %RH = SRH / 2^20 × 100 |
| `0x14` to `0x1C` | reserved | read, write | not used in the project |

### The functions you use

| Function | What it does |
|---|---|
| `iom361_initialize(num_switches, num_leds, &rc)` | sets up the model and returns the base address of the registers. Call it once, at the start of `main`. Afterward the switches and LEDs are 0, the RGB LED is off, and the sensor reads 23.5 °C and 75 %RH. |
| `iom361_readReg(base, offset, &rc)` | reads one register. Use the names in the table above for `offset`. |
| `iom361_writeReg(base, offset, value, &rc)` | writes one register and returns what it holds afterward. Writes to the read-only registers are ignored. |
| `build_rgb_reg(enable, red, green, blue)` | builds a value for `RGB_LED_REG` from an enable bit and three duty cycles, 0 to 255 |
| `iom361_set_display(on)` | `false` stops the model from printing the LEDs (see below) |

Every function that takes `&rc` sets it: 0 for success, 1 for a wrong base address or bad arguments, 2 for an offset out of range, 3 for an offset that is not a multiple of 4, and 5 if `iom361_initialize` has not been called. Check it: a register function that fails returns `0xDEADBEEF`, which looks like a perfectly good reading.

### The functions that stand in for the world

A real device gets its temperature from the air and its switch positions from a person. In the model, your code sets them:

- `_iom361_set_sensor1(temp, humidity)` sets the next reading, in °C and %RH.
- `_iom361_set_switches(value)` sets the switch register.

Only the scenario replay in `main.c` and your tests call these two. `sensor.c` and `fsm.c` never do: on a real board they would not exist.

### An example

This program sets up the model for your cleanroom pressure monitor, plays the world for a moment, reads the sensor and a switch, and lights an LED and the RGB LED. It compiles with `gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra example.c iom361_r4.c`.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "iom361_r4.h"

int main(void) {
    int rc;
    uint32_t *base = iom361_initialize(1, 3, &rc);      /* 1 switch, 3 LEDs */
    if (base == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "iom361_initialize failed: %d\n", rc);
        return 1;
    }

    _iom361_set_sensor1(20.0f, 45.0f);                  /* the "world": 20.0 C, 45 %RH */
    _iom361_set_switches(0x1);                          /* the "world": ACK on */

    uint32_t raw = iom361_readReg(base, TEMP_REG, &rc);
    double temp = raw / 1048576.0 * 200.0 - 50.0;       /* AHT20 formula */
    uint32_t sw = iom361_readReg(base, SWITCHES_REG, &rc);

    if (sw & 0x1u)                                      /* ACK is switch 0 */
        iom361_writeReg(base, LEDS_REG, 0x1u, &rc);     /* DEGRADED_LAMP is LED 0 */
    iom361_writeReg(base, RGB_LED_REG, build_rgb_reg(1, 255, 0, 0), &rc); /* red */

    printf("raw 0x%05X = %.4f C, switches 0x%X\n", (unsigned) raw, temp, (unsigned) sw);
    return 0;
}
```

It prints the LEDs (`__o`: LED 0 on), the RGB LED, and then `raw 0x5999A = 20.0001 C, switches 0x1`. In your project this code is split up: the conversion goes into `sensor.c`, the decisions into `fsm.c`, and the calls to `_iom361_set_sensor1` and `_iom361_set_switches` into the scenario replay and your tests.

### Three things to know

1. **The model prints.** Every write to `LEDS_REG` or `RGB_LED_REG` prints a line to standard output, the way a board would light up. When your program replays a scenario, it calls `iom361_set_display(false)` first, so that its trace is not mixed with the LED display.
2. **Readings are close, not exact.** The registers hold 20-bit integers, so a value comes back within 0.0001 of what was set, slightly above or slightly below: set 91.0 °C and the register gives back 90.99998 °C, which is below a 91.0 °C threshold. `sensor.c` rounds every reading to 0.1 °C and 0.1 %RH, so that a scenario that sets 91.0 reads 91.0.
3. **There is no clock.** Your program keeps time itself (see Time, below).

## 3. Behavior

### States

The states are given. The events and the transition table are yours.

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `NORMAL` | within specification (initial state) |
| `DEGRADED` | slightly out of specification |
| `BREACH` | far out of specification, alarm held |
| `RECOVERY` | back in specification, being watched before it counts as NORMAL |

### Inputs and outputs

`iom361_initialize(1, 3, &rc)`: 1 switch, 3 LEDs. Switch k and LED k are bit k of their registers. A **level** switch means something for as long as it is on. A **press** is an event: each change of its bit from 0 to 1 counts once.

| Bit | Switch | Kind | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `ACK` | press | Acknowledges a breach |

| Bit | LED | On means |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `DEGRADED_LAMP` | degraded |
| 1 | `BREACH_ALARM` | breach |
| 2 | `RECOVERY_LAMP` | recovering |

The RGB LED shows the state: one distinct color per state, listed in `SPEC.md`.

### Operating rules

1. Specification: 20.0 ± 0.5 °C and 45 ± 3 %RH. DEGRADED outside that. BREACH outside 20.0 ± 1.5 °C or 45 ± 8 %RH.
2. BREACH is held until ACK, then RECOVERY.
3. RECOVERY becomes NORMAL after 300 ticks in specification; a reading out of specification sends it to DEGRADED.

Where a rule is silent, you decide. Examples you will meet: ACK when not in BREACH; a breach during RECOVERY; a reading out of specification in temperature but in specification in humidity. Write each decision in `SPEC.md` and test it.

## 4. What you build

Everything lives in `project/` in your repository.

### Time

Your device keeps time the way a Unix computer does: as a `time_t`, the number of seconds since the Unix epoch, 1 January 1970, 00:00:00 UTC. The scenario file gives the start time, and the clock advances by one second per tick. Every reading gets a timestamp: the start time plus the tick.

- Store timestamps as `time_t`, and use `<time.h>`: `gmtime()` to break a timestamp into date and time, and `strftime()` to print it as `2026-10-06 08:00:46`.
- All times are UTC, so a trace is the same on every computer, whatever its time zone.
- Durations in the rules (ticks) are differences between timestamps, in seconds.
- In `SPEC.md`, answer: what would happen to your device on 19 January 2038 if `time_t` were 32 bits?

### `sensor.h`, `sensor.c`

- `reading_t`: the timestamp (`time_t`), the temperature in °C, and the humidity in %RH, as floats.
- A function that reads the temperature and humidity registers and converts them with the formulas in the register table above, rounded to 0.1 °C and 0.1 %RH. Return the reading through a pointer and report failure through the return value.
- No `printf` in this module.

### `fsm.h`, `fsm.c`

- An `enum` for the 4 states and an `enum` for your events.
- A transition table: an array, indexed by state and event, that gives the next state and the action. Not a chain of `if` statements.
- One function that takes the current state and an event and returns the next state.
- The code that turns a reading and the switch register into events lives here or in `main.c`. Where it lives is your decision; defend it in `SPEC.md`.

### `store.h`, `store.c`: binary search tree, key K1

- `record_t`: the reading, the state at that moment, and the status word.
- An opaque type: `store.h` declares `typedef struct store store_t;`, and only `store.c` knows what is inside.
- Ordered by timestamp. Write the comparison as one function, `record_compare`, and test it on its own.
- Timestamps are unique and arrive in increasing order. What does that do to the shape of your tree, and what do you do about it? Answer in `SPEC.md`.
- At least: create, insert, find by key, an in-order walk with a callback, count, height, and destroy.
- Start early: implement `store.h` first as a sorted array or linked list, and replace the inside with your tree when we cover trees in week 8. If the interface is right, nothing outside `store.c` changes.

### `aux.h`, `aux.c`: hash table with separate chaining, S4

- A hash table with separate chaining, from state to the number of readings and the total ticks. Use exactly 3 buckets, fewer than the 4 states, so chains do form.
- Opaque type. At least: create, insert or update the entry for a state, look up a state, visit every entry, and destroy.
- The hash function is your choice. Defend it in `SPEC.md`, and say which states end up in the same bucket.

### `report.h`, `report.c`: top-k extreme readings, Q2

- The k = 5 readings with the largest temperature deviation from 20.0 °C, with their tick and state. Ties are broken by the earlier tick.
- k is a parameter. With fewer than k readings, report all of them. With none, report nothing and say so.
- It reads the store through `store.h` only.

### Status word

One `uint32_t`, packed and unpacked with your HW1 `get_field` and `set_field`:

- the state (2 bits)
- `DEGRADED_LAMP` (1 bit)
- `BREACH_ALARM` (1 bit)
- `RECOVERY_LAMP` (1 bit)
- breach unacknowledged (1 bit)

You choose the bit positions. Unused bits are 0.

### `main.c`: the program

`main` initializes iom361, then loops: advance the clock by one second, read the sensor, read the switches, run the state machine, write the LEDs and the RGB LED, store a record, and update your hash table with separate chaining. It has two modes:

- `./cleanroom scenario.txt` replays a scenario file (below) and prints one trace line per tick.
- `./cleanroom scenario.txt --report` replays it and prints only the report.

### Scenario files

A scenario is a plain text file. The first line that is not a comment gives the start time as a Unix timestamp. Each line after it gives a tick (seconds since the start), a temperature, a humidity, and the switch register in hexadecimal. Lines starting with `#` are comments. Between lines, the values hold. For example:

```
start 1791273600                # 2026-10-06 08:00:00 UTC
# tick  temp   rh    switches
0       20.0   45    0x0
5       20.0   45    0x1      # ACK pressed
6       20.0   45    0x0      # and released
60      21.0   45    0x0
```

`main` feeds these values to iom361 through `_iom361_set_sensor1()` and `_iom361_set_switches()`. This format is the same for every project.

### Trace output

One line per tick, so that a test can compare it with a file of expected output. For example:

```
2026-10-06 08:00:46 state=DEGRADED temp=20.0 rh=45.0 leds=0x1 status=0x00000011
```

The status value depends on your bit layout.

## 5. Deliverables

At the freeze, **Sun Dec 6, 11:59pm**, `project/` contains:

| File or folder | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `sensor.[ch]`, `fsm.[ch]`, `store.[ch]`, `aux.[ch]`, `report.[ch]`, `main.c` | the code |
| `iom361_r4.h`, `iom361_r4.c` | the hardware model, unchanged |
| `Makefile` | `make` builds `cleanroom`; `make test` builds and runs every test; `make clean` removes everything that was built |
| `tests/` | unit tests per module, and scenario tests |
| `scenarios/` | your scenario files, each with its expected trace or report |
| `SPEC.md` | see below |
| `AI_USAGE.md` | which tools you used, for what, and one thing a tool got wrong |
| `ASSIGNMENT.md` | this sheet |

`SPEC.md` contains:

- your events, and the transition table as a table: state, event, next state, action
- a drawing of the state machine (ASCII, or an image in the repository)
- every decision where a rule was silent
- `record_t`, and what arriving in timestamp order does to your tree, and what you did about it
- your hash function, and which states share a bucket
- the exact definition of your report
- the bit layout of your status word
- the RGB color of each state
- the answer to the 2038 question
- one paragraph that defends or criticizes the states you were given
- one paragraph that compares your hash table with separate chaining with one alternative from the reading, with the cost of each operation

## 6. How you test it

`make test` runs everything and ends with one line: the number of tests that passed and failed. It must build with `gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra` with no warnings and run clean under `-fsanitize=address,undefined`.

**Unit tests, at least these:**

- `record_compare`: an earlier, a later, and an equal timestamp.
- The clock: the start time prints as given; 59 seconds later; one second after 23:59:59 is 00:00:00 on the next day; 28 February 2027 to 1 March.
- `store`: insert into an empty tree; find a record that is there and one that is not; the in-order walk visits records in key order; count and height after 1, 2, and 100 inserts in timestamp order; destroy an empty tree.
- `aux`: look up a state that was never inserted; two states in the same bucket; update an existing entry; destroy a table whose buckets have chains.
- `report`: no readings; fewer than k; exactly k; ties.
- The status word: pack then unpack gives back every field; unused bits are 0.
- The sensor conversion at 0 °C, at 100 °C, and at one of the thresholds in your rules.

**Scenario tests, at least these seven,** each in `scenarios/` with its expected output:

1. **Normal operation:** in specification, a slow drift to DEGRADED, and back to NORMAL.
2. **Every state:** the device passes through every state at least twice, so that every chain is used; the totals in the table add up to the length of the run.
3. **Thresholds:** every temperature and humidity threshold in your rules, set to exactly its value. Which side of each threshold is which is your decision; the test shows it.
4. **Rule 3:** the situation in rule 3 happens, your device responds as the rule says, and then the situation clears.
5. **Unexpected input:** every switch changes at least once in every state. Nothing crashes, and the trace matches what `SPEC.md` says.
6. **Report:** a run of at least 30 readings, replayed with `--report`, whose expected output covers the special cases of your report.
7. **Midnight:** a scenario that starts at 23:59:40 and runs across midnight; the trace shows the date change.

## 7. When you are done

Your project is complete when:

- `make` and `make test` pass from a fresh clone, with no warnings;
- every scenario test matches its expected output;
- `SPEC.md` answers everything listed above;
- you can explain and change any line of it without help. The final exam asks you to.

## 8. A plan for the term

The homework builds the pieces; this is where each one lands in your cleanroom pressure monitor. Commit to `project/` every week.

| Week | Homework | Your cleanroom pressure monitor |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | Modules and makefiles | the five module stubs and a `Makefile` that links them with iom361; `ASSIGNMENT.md` and a first `SPEC.md` |
| 3 | Pointers | the interfaces in `sensor.h` and `store.h`; the status word |
| 4 | ADTs, opaque types | `reading_t`, `record_t`, and `store.h`; the store as a sorted array for now |
| 5 | State machines | `fsm.c` and the transition table; scenarios 1, 3, and 4 |
| 6 | iom361 registers | `sensor.c`, the clock, and `main.c`: the scenario replay and the trace; scenarios 5 and 7 |
| 7 | Stacks and queues | `aux.h` only; the hash table itself comes in week 9 |
| 8 | Binary search trees | the tree inside `store.c` |
| 9 | Hash tables, testing | `aux.c`: your hash table; `report.c`; scenarios 2 and 6; the remaining unit tests |
| 10 | none | finish, harden, and complete `SPEC.md` |
